# MetaSub-Challenge
A jupyter notebook for the classification of metagenomic samples by city/continent.

This notebook uses a random forest model to assign city/continent labels to metagenomic samples. I use bacteria abundance values (derived from the MetaPhlAn2 software) as features for classification.

The results of this analysis were presented at the July 2019 CAMDA conference in Switzerland.
