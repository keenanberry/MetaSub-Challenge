# MetaSub-Challenge
A jupyter notebook for the classification of metagenomic samples by city/continent.

This notebook uses a random forest model to assign city/continent labels to metagenomic samples. Bacteria abundance values (derived from the MetaPhlAn2 software) are used as features for classification.

The results of this analysis were presented at the July 2019 ISMB ECCB conference in Basel, Switzerland.
